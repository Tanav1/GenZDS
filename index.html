                <h3> Cell Phones and Mental Health </h3>

                <p>When did you get your first cell phone? 

                <div> I got my first phone when I was 13. My parents on the other hand didn't get their own till their 20's-30's. With the evolution of technology at an advanced rate, devices like cell phones, laptops, and tablets are being manufactured and sold at a more affordable price than ever. This is great, right? Well for the most part yes. But there are many other side effects that come with being surrounded by technology 24/7. </div>

                <div>Right now there is an estimated 300 million cell phones being used in the United States. There are unseen side effects. "From 2012 to 2017, the prevalence of past-year Major Depressive Episode (MDE) increased from 8.66 percent to 13.01 percent of youth ages 12-17. Now over two million youth have MDE with severe impairment."</div>

                <div> Is this a coincedence? Lets look at some statistics:  </div>
                
                <div> According to "Mental Health America", "Major depression in youth has increased 4.35 percent over the last 6 years - meaning over 2 million youth have severe depression. Shockingly, almost 60 percent of youth with major depression do not receive any mental health treatment." </div>
